Implementation of FMM with Z-curve and Octtree
- [x] Generate random points of given count and of given dimension.
- [x] Perform Z-order curve on the points and get the sorted points.
- [x] Build an octtree from the sorted points.
- [x] Implement multipole expansion of FMM on each node.
- [x] Compute and store near and far field for each node in the tree.
